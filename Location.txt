The Pañcāla state was located to the west of the Gomti river, and the north of the Chambal River. Its western neighbours were the Sūrasenas and the Yakṛllomas, while in the north-west it was separated from the Gaṅgā and the Kurus by dense forests. The northern boundaries of Pañcāla were the forests around the region of the Gaṅgā's source. The territory of Pañcāla corresponded to the modern-day areas of Rohilkhand such as Bareilly, Budaun, Shahjahanpur, Kannauj such as Farrukhabad, Kannauj and Kanpur, and parts of Awadh such as the western half of Hardoi, and parts of Lakhimpur[4][5] as well as the Central Gaṅgā-Yamunā Doab in Uttar Pradesh.
